GreenBook - 3rd Assignment
====================================
Third Assignment developed for the Software Development Process course delivered at the University of Milano - Bicocca.

### Introduction to GreenBook
Due to the outbreak of the recent COVID-19 pandemic, restaurant owners have found themselves facing many new challenges for guaranteeing safety in the workplace for both customers and employees alike. And while many of these situations require a practical solution, like making sure thereâ€™s enough distance between tables and that everybody is wearing a mask or authenticating green pass certificates at the entrance, others, like storing contact trace information, require a more careful approach and a long-term strategy is best suited to handle them.

We developed a web app, called GreenBook, to meet the needs of restaurant managers throughout this pandemic. By storing the contact trace information of every customer and recording the employees present in the restaurant on a particular date and shift we are able to guarantee, in the event of a Covid-19 positive case, perfect traceability of all the people that need to be contactacted.

### Assignment goal
Develop a Spring application (MVC and data persistency).

The application must implement CRUD (create, read, update, delete) and at least a search operation on a set of entities. There must be at least 4 entities in the system (with inheritance between at least 2 of entities) and at least 3 relationships (including at least a many-to-many and a self-loop relationship) between those entities.
