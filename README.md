GreenBook - 3rd Assignment
====================================
Third Assignment developed for the Software Development Process course delivered at the University of Milano - Bicocca.

### Assignment goal
Develop a Spring application (MVC and data persistency).

The application must implement CRUD (create, read, update, delete) and at least a search operation on a set of entities. There must be at least 4 entities in the system (with inheritance between at least 2 of entities) and at least 3 relationships (including at least a many-to-many and a self-loop relationship) between those entities.
